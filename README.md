# Writing an E2E test using Protractor

## Objectives

- Test bound Directives we've created

## Instructions

Using the files we have provided in this repo, edit `spec/Index.spec.js` to test our application.

We should test that we can click on the "Add" button, and that it adds a new contact to the list.

We should also test that the second contact has the correct name and phone number.
